# N-Badge Extensions

This directory contains extensions containing the N-Badge logic that you can use to create contracts that utilize the logic. Like traditional code libraries, these extensions are to be inherited from by your Ethereum smart contracts saving you the need to re-write the system everytime while being able to utilize the wisdom of those before you.

> Important: These extensions are not meant to be deployed as-is. They are meant to be inherited from by your contracts. If you deploy them as-is, you will not be able to use them.

If you need support for contracts already deployed, you can utilize the N-Badge Registry to utilize the borrowed logic while providing your own configuration.
